# 1. Project background and related work
The project is focused on creating a serverless shopping cart microservice using AWS
cloud services. The project aims to develop a scalable, highly available, and costeffective
solution for handling large traffic and sustaining the growing popularity of ecommerce
services. The project builds on previous research in serverless computing and
e-commerce applications.

# 2. Project Objective
The objective of the project is to develop a serverless shopping cart microservice that
can handle large traffic, scale dynamically, and reduce infrastructure costs. The
microservice should be able to handle anonymous carts and logged in carts and migrate
items between them seamlessly. The microservice should also be able to remove
expired items and allow admins to monitor product quantities in users' carts.

# 3. Challenges and/or Motivation
The main challenge of the project is to design a scalable, highly available, and costeffective
solution for handling large traffic in the e-commerce industry. Another
challenge is to develop a seamless migration system for anonymous carts and logged in
carts. The motivation for the project is to provide an efficient and cost-effective solution
for the growing e-commerce industry.
